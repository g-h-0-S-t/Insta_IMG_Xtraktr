# Insta_IMG_Xtraktr
Extract images from any page in Instagram on a Web Browser.

### Step 1 :
Visit the desired page (a profile, or explore, or home, etc.)
### Step 2 :
Run https://github.com/g-h-0-S-t/scrollBot , if you want to load all the images. Try positioning the scroll-bar at the mid for best results after all the images have been loaded in the browser.
### Step 3 : 
Run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-h-0-S-t/Insta_IMG_Xtraktr/main/Insta_IMG_Xtraktr.js as either a Browser Bookmark or as you feel comfortable.
### Step 4 : 
Keep hitting the 'Enter' key, LOL. Better, keep it pressed. For cancelling, hit escape and refresh the Browser.
